        "description": "<div class=\"h2\"><strong>hi there, thanks for stopping by.</strong></div>\n<p>What follows is a bit lengthy, but will give you a better idea of what we do, what this role entails and how to apply.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>what we do</strong></div>\n<p>We're a boutique growth agency that gives a damn about our work, our clients, our people, and doing the right thing. We specialize in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>user experience research and design</li>\n<li>full-service a/b testing and personalization (aka conversion rate optimization)</li>\n<li>data analytics</li>\n<li>email</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>about your role and team</strong></div>\n<p>If you would rather feel trusted to use your expertise and problem-solve than have your manager hawking over your shoulder micromanaging you, keep reading! Here at surefoot, we hire smart, entrepreneurially-minded folks and get out of their way so they have the space to deliver real value to our clients. Leave the wasted time, infighting and red tape to someone else. You didn't become a developer to deal with that stress mess day in and day out!</p>\n<p>As an engineer at surefoot, you'll work closely with product managers, project managers, designers and QA to build tests the team has prioritized for e-commerce clients like Hydro Flask, Peak Design, OXO, Made In and others. This is a unique front-end role, as you'll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like Dynamic Yield, Convert or Google Optimize. Ethical hacking, of sorts. Something important we want you to know ahead of time is that this job is a bit different than your standard front-end gig. You won't be working on a single app or feature for several months. Instead, you'll be writing smaller chunks of code on a lot of different projects for a variety of clients. One day it could be an exit intent modal, the next could be restructuring a nav \u2013 the possibilities are endless. Your code will sometimes (often) be part of a losing test and never see the light of production, which is one reason we value efficiency over perfect, beautiful code.</p>\n<p>Internally, you'll enjoy collaborating with kind, supportive co-workers who respect you and your time \u2013 both at and away from the virtual office. You'll be recognized by peers, leadership and clients for your curiosity and attention to detail, which are critical to your success. In fact, \u201cdo the bare minimum\u201d, dependent personalities don't last long here. Nor do people with \u201cthat's not in my job description\u201d attitudes. When smart people collaborate instead of compete and bring solutions instead of problems, amazing things happen.</p>\n<p>Speaking of collaboration, that's something you'll occasionally do with our clients. We bend over backwards (but not forwards) to make sure they're happy. Our goal is to be the best, most helpful agency they've ever worked with. To help us achieve that goal, we encourage you to share and celebrate your authentic self day in-and-day-out with co-workers and clients alike. Even if it means letting your \u201cweird\u201d show every once in awhile.</p>\n<p>We'll be honest; surefoot isn't for everyone. We encourage and expect you to use your expertise, make decisions without a lot of oversight, go above and beyond to help a teammate or client, spend time to thoughtfully communicate asynchronously, and manage your own work schedule. If you're a humble team player who likes to see and contribute to the success of something greater than yourself, then we want you to apply.

We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.</p>\n<p>Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that \u201csexism goes both ways,\u201d and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege\u2014these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis. One look at Legible.com will show how committed we are to diversity and inclusivity. We are a company that will beautifully entwine, celebrates, and support diverse cultures and varying beliefs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few years ago, an interviewer asked Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the Broadway smash-hit Hamilton, why his cast was so diverse.

Roadmunk was born out of a problem our founders experienced personally: there was no simple way for product managers to collect feedback, surface customer-driven insights and create roadmaps using a single platform. So we went out and built it for ourselves, making sure it was collaborative, beautifully designed and secure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today, we are home to thousands of forward-thinking product teams including those from organizations like Disney, Sonos and Under Armour.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2019, Roadmunk was 12th in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Awards for its rapid revenue growth and bold innovation. The Fast 50 program recognizes Canada\u2019s 50 fastest growing technology companies with the highest revenue-growth percentage over the past four years.

While the in-office perks such as on-site drinks and snacks, monthly team social events, and the occasional visit from some four-legged colleagues have been temporarily put on hold, our culture of innovation, teamwork, balance and diversity continues as strong as ever.

A\u00b7Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A\u00b7Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A\u00b7Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\n<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters.

Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A\u00b7Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.\u00a0</li>\n<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere.

Now we're ready to take our sales to the next level!</p>\n<div class=\"h3\">What You'll Work On</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Manage deals.</strong> Own the deal from inquiry through contract signature. Engage with both large enterprises and startups.</li>\n<li><strong>Showcase the product.</strong> Show customers how the Gruntwork product works. Answer both their high-level strategic questions and common technical questions. When necessary, collaborate with our engineering team to answer a detailed question or build your knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Make customer-driven tweaks where needed. </strong>Does the customer want to see an integration out of the box we don't yet support? You can add it directly, following the patterns we've laid down with other integrations.</li>\n<li><strong>Develop new markets. </strong>Our product works well for customers building greenfield in AWS or doing migrations. What kinds of customers might find themselves in that situation? Identify those opportunities, figure out what the customer wants, and write content/guides to help showcase our solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Experience in tech.</strong> You understand the cloud, are familiar with core elements of at least one major cloud provider, and have experience selling to software engineers. Ideally, you have some kind of background in engineering or coding from earlier in your career.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical skill.</strong> You're tech-savvy, can build a full mental model of our product, and can learn to demo a core part of it on your own. At the same time, you know when to bring in the product engineers to assist.</li>\n<li><strong>Sales skill.</strong> You can effectively qualify leads, understand customer needs, demo our product, and close the deal with a range of customers from startups to large enterprises. You delight both in knowing the product and signing up customers who will genuinely benefit from it.</li>\n<li><strong>Moral grounding.</strong> You feel comfortable saying no when necessary so that we can all sleep better at night. In general, you do the right thing for customers, for Gruntwork, and for yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Above-Market Salary.</strong> To reduce bias and increase transparency, we compute all salaries <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-we-hire-at-gruntwork-42193d583e24\" rel=\"nofollow\">using formulas</a>. The formula factors in your title and location and uses a multiplier to produce a result that's above market for that title and location.</li>\n<li><strong>Profit-Sharing Bonus.</strong> We set aside a pot of money at the end of each year based on profits and distribute bonuses according to a formula that uses as inputs your level within the company and the length of your tenure at the company.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Bonus.</strong> We give performance-based bonuses as often as once a quarter, depending on your performance. NOTE: We have not yet decided on a commission structure, if any.</li>\n<li><strong>Progressive Equity.</strong> We grant <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://medium.com/detour-dot-com/introducing-progressive-equity-f424a51ee3a4\" rel=\"nofollow\">progressive equity</a> to all new Grunts. This means that, in the case of a large exit (e.g., acquisition), the financial benefits get distributed more evenly across the whole team rather than solely going to the founders.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical/Dental/Vision Insurance.</strong> We offer a range of high-quality plans with a large portion paid by the company.</li>\n<li><strong>FSA and HSAs.</strong> We don't contribute to these accounts, but we do offer them as an option.</li>\n<li><strong>401(k).</strong> We contribute a portion of your salary to your pension or 401(k).</li>\n<li><strong>Disability insurance.</strong> If you get disabled, we have a policy that will pay out a portion of your salary.</li>\n<li><strong>Hardware budget.</strong> We'll buy you a brand new benchmark Apple laptop upon joining. It will be owned by you, not the company.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal Budget.</strong> We'll give you a personal budget of one thousand dollars per month to spend on your workspace (e.g., a co-working space), health (e.g., gym, yoga), time (e.g., babysitter), and/or learning (e.g., books, courses).</li>\n<li><strong>Minimum Vacation.</strong> We require that you take at least 4 weeks of vacation per year. And we'll track it to make sure you do!</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h3\">Life First, Then Work</div>\n<p>We believe in planning our work around our lives, not the other way around. To help achieve that we offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Remote work</strong> that lets you control your hours and physical location.</li>\n<li><strong>Normal working hours</strong> that usually amount to not more than ~40h per week, and no working on weekends or holidays.</li>\n<li><strong>Deliberate project planning</strong> that takes into account the time zone of all team members.</li>\n<li><strong>A minimum vacation policy</strong> where you must take at least 4 weeks per year away from work.</li>\n<li><strong>No one carrying a pager</strong> and no on-call rotation. We enable this by only offering support contracts with SLAs of responses on business days / hours only.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h3\">What time zones do we work in?</div>\n<p>While Gruntwork <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://deploy-preview-359--keen-clarke-470db9.netlify.app/careers/#sane-working-hours\" rel=\"nofollow\">generally</a> hires anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, candidates for this role must be within the GMT-7 to GMT-3 time zones, with a preference for being located in the USA or Canada. We expect you'll work primarily with customers and fellow Grunts in those time zones, with limited engagement with customers worldwide and Grunts in Europe. Working during reasonable hours is a priority for us.</p>\n"

Zapier has helped millions of people build businesses through the power of automation.</p>\n<p>Talented people can be found everywhere, but quite often the best people aren't even thinking about a career change. This is where Zapier\u2019s Talent Sourcers come in. The sleuths and connectors of Zapier's Recruiting team, we spend our time searching far and wide across the web (from LinkedIn to GitHub to Twitter and everywhere in between). We dive deep into online communities to uncover great people, and reach out to these people in thoughtful ways to entice them to join Zapier.</p>\n<p>Here at Zapier, we know Talent Sourcing can be more than pipeline building and candidate generation. Sourcing is a strategic and highly-valued technical craft that combines a deep curiosity to understand humans and their motivations around work, and the perseverance to find the right people and connect with them with the right opportunities in the right ways.</p>\n<p>As Zapier\u2019s resident expert in the talent market, you will help shape the future of our company and build a robust network of technical candidates to support Zapier's effort to attract, recruit, and hire a diverse and talented team that reflects our global customer base.

Here are some specifics about what Jane is all about, and with these, hopefully, you have a better idea if this might be the kind of company you want to be part of.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>We\u2019re a North Vancouver-born SaaS company with a distributed remote team across Canada, and our platform is modernizing the world of practice management software.

Last year we processed over 37 million patient appointments, and our scheduling application alone handles on average 10 million API calls per day. We\u2019re profitable, product-led and growing organically to the point where 85% of our customer growth is either from customer referrals or word of mouth. Growth like this is unique, especially in the world of SaaS, and it doesn\u2019t happen by chance. We have a brilliant team of over 240 employees who all do an amazing job of listening to our customers, building what they need, and providing industry-leading support.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>This year alone we\u2019ve grown our development team from 36 to 63, and the product team has doubled as a whole. 2022 is going to be a big year for Jane as we\u2019re investing heavily into patient experience with our first patient-facing mobile app, enhancing our telehealth experience, building our own (J)analytics platform, working on global insurance integrations, and introducing new features like HIPAA compliant chat.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Jane is now the number one choice for Allied Healthcare practitioners in Canada.

Behind the platform, we\u2019re real people who celebrate diversity, individuality, and inclusion every day. We adopt a communicative digital culture that thrives on transparency, inquisitive learning, gifs, and emojis.</p>\n<p>Our core values underpin how we work together day-to-day and the support we give to our customers and team members. We strive to empower our team members to be self-directed and self-motivated in their roles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Think critically:</strong> We're reflective and open to challenge. As critical thinkers, we can use data to comprehensively explore issues, ideas, and events with a customer-centric approach before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion. If our perspectives and assumptions are mistaken or incomplete, we acknowledge it and are willing to change what we are doing or what we believe in the light of these critical insights.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn continuously.</strong> We're crazy about self-development and take every opportunity we can to learn. Every failure, victory, difficult conversation, and instance of feedback are a chance to learn and improve daily. When we fail, we take ownership of our mistakes, reflect on them and learn. When we succeed, we ensure we celebrate this and share our achievements with others.</li>\n<li><strong>Assert and empathize:</strong> We're candid in expressing our wants and needs while still considering the rights, demands, and wants of others. We make an effort to make ourselves understood by engaging in proactive communication. We ask questions when we are uncertain, speak up when having an opinion or idea, ask for help when we need it, question the status quo, and speak up when we feel reserved, embarrassed, or fear being wrong or upsetting people. If a conflict should arise, we are patient and receptive to other peoples' viewpoints. We are committed to helping others achieve success.</li>\n<li><strong>Innovate and adapt:</strong> We move forward with an adaptive mindset, and we're not afraid to do things differently or change the way we do things. We thrive in environments of constant change and see opportunities where others see risk. Our mindset doesn\u2019t depend on scale or resources; instead, we draw on our creativity and scrappiness for varied solutions and optimization of opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust</strong>: We define trust as the belief and confidence in our people and organization's integrity, reliability, and fairness. We bring the best of who we are to our work, and we take ownership in collaborating, cooperating, and contributing to achieve our mission and ensure our customers have all the support they need to reach their creative goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistently deliver memorable experiences:</strong> We are committed to excellence and dedicated to raising the bar in making every user experience exceptionally memorable. Our customers should leave happy even if they don't buy from us. Clients and buyers should refer others to us, even if we didn't fulfill their projects. Talents should be excited, even if they don't pass our application process. Candidates for our job openings should love us and tell all their friends about us even if we don't hire them. Team members should love Bunny Studio - its people, processes, technology stack, payroll, culture, and more - even after leaving our team. We should be fanatical about delivering remarkable experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take a look <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://bunnystudio.com/blog/bunny-studio-behind-the-scenes/?utm_source=workable&amp;utm_campaign=jobdescription\" rel=\"nofollow\">behind the scenes of how we work. </a>For more information on how we collaborate worldwide, check out our blog <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://bunnystudio.com/blog/we-are-bunny-studio/how-to-work-remotely/?utm_source=workable&amp;utm_campaign=jobdescription\" rel=\"nofollow\">We Are Bunny Studio</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the whole organization, we aim to provide a multicultural experience and equal opportunities.

One of the most diversified and fastest-growing technology providers of integrated software solutions, we are innovative leaders in the industry and respond to the needs of our clients through products that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A2Z Events, a multi-event platform that enables clients to manage their events from start to finish, including floor plans, financials, managing contracts and sponsorships, and increasing engagement through mobile applications and a networking suite.</li>\n<li>CommUnity, an online community platform for those with common interests to connect, learn and collaborate.</li>\n<li>Wild Apricot, an all-in-one solution that automates and simplifies workflows enabling nonprofits and associations to manage their membership, streamline their processes, and make room for human connections.</li>\n<li>Member Clicks, an easy-to-use member management cloud solution aimed at small to medium-sized nonprofit organizations and associations.</li>\n<li>ThreeSixty, an enterprise management solution for associations, nonprofits, YMCAs and JCCs to engage, manage and grow their membership.</li>\n<li>And more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At Personify, we're in the relationship building business, powering conversations, donations, events, and foundations through analytics, tools, and robust backend management systems. With 300+ employees in our offices in Austin, Atlanta, and Toronto, and as part of remote teams across Canada and the US, we're the people designing the technology that reaches 30,000+ clients resulting in 3B+ interactions a year with our products. Joining us is a chance to take your skills and expertise and build solutions for the real world that strengthen the connection between clients, their mission and their communities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who we need</p>\n<p>We're looking for a Content Marketing Manager to join our SaaS inbound marketing team and grow our content acquisition machine. Under our Senior Content Marketing Manager, you will own the content for MemberClicks as a part of our Small-Medium Business (SMB) unit.</p>\n<p>SEO is a crucial driver for our segment, and you're going to be instrumental in making MemberClicks an industry-leading brand publisher in our space. You will work across the marketing funnel, write to the needs of our audience (Nonprofits, trade associations, Chambers of Commerce, etc.), and have a direct impact on business results. You will blend your fine-tuned analytical skills with your creative mind by developing content that appeals to Google's algorithm, supports the buying journey, and helps our audience increase the impact of their mission-driven organizations.</p>\n<p>Who you are</p>\n<p>You're a wordsmith by trade and are always looking for ways to improve your writing, editorial, and proofreading (hey, grammar nerds!) skills. But you go beyond being a Creative: you bring an understanding of B2B strategy, full-funnel marketing, and content optimization. You care about how your content impacts business results and are motivated to take ownership of reporting on what is or isn't working.</p>\n<p>If you've been involved in the nonprofit sector as a volunteer, staff member, marketer, board member, or otherwise, make sure you highlight this experience: already understanding our audience could give you a leg up in the application process!</p>\n<p>What's in it for you</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Influence and balance. MemberClicks is a recent acquisition, with an exciting opportunity to be a part of a transformative SEO project. You will own a massive library of content to build a strategy. You will be the owner and the driver of the voice and messaging, reaching an audience of small-to-mid-sized associations, chambers and nonprofits seeking solutions. This is a chance to use content to create real business results.</li>\n<li>In-demand skills growth. You'll get to partner with a technical SEO Consultant, immediately growing your understanding of how to optimize content. You will learn what parts of a website or web page do and don't affect SEO (diving into page speed, mobile responsiveness, data structure, etc.) as well as SEO for video content.\u00a0</li>\n<li>An impactful multifaceted role. You will be part of a robust content programme, contributing as a content strategist, writer, editor, and project manager. You'll have access to a team of freelancers and a content agency to make your magic happen, and you'll have access to the data you need to see the tangible results of your work.</li>\n<li>Career development. You will report to a manager who prides themselves on supporting their team's career progression and skills development. They will guide and coach you towards increased independence and autonomy in your role. You will build the expertise and exposure to move up to a Senior Marketing Manager, Content Strategist, or SEO Consultant here or elsewhere. Or move into another vertical at Personify, further broadening your skills.</li>\n<li>Collaboration, both casual and corporate. At Personify, we offer a balance between established and responsive, between new and tenured. We are proud to say many of our team members have been here for 5, 10, even 15 years, alongside the teammates who've joined us recently. While this is a fully remote role, the option to join us in our casual, energetic Toronto office is open (when you feel comfortable doing so). You will be part of an incredible Content Marketing team working together to create content that really matters to our audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How you will make an impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grow your knowledge. You will dive into learning about our customers: nonprofits, associations, clubs, and membership organizations. You will explore their web-based groups, newsletters, etc., understand how to position our solutions and comprehend how they are already - or could be - engaging us. You will develop and launch a quarterly webinar series featuring key industry leaders in the association space.</li>\n<li>Produce whip-smart content. You will outline, assign, edit, and publish blog content that drives traffic to our site and provides real value to our audience. You will plan and write high-value gated content (ebooks, guides, checklists, etc.), resulting in a high conversion rate. To help you get great work done on time, you will oversee and guide 2-4 freelancers and work with our content agency to create strategic guest posts that build our backlink profile.</li>\n<li>Collaborate to drive results. You will work with our Senior Content Marketing Manager and our SEO Consultant to create content within a portfolio SEO strategy that promotes MemberClicks to our target prospects\u2014without cannibalizing the target markets of Personify's other brands. You will gain and apply new insights and approaches to optimizing content.</li>\n<li>Apply full-funnel thinking to the content you create. You will build out your understanding of how thought leadership and nurture content come together to position our solutions as the answer to target markets' pain points. You will continuously seek out best practices for lead generation through content marketing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What you bring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The education and experience. You have 2+ years of experience in a B2B Content Marketing or SEO role, preferably for a SaaS company or agency. Exposure to the SMB segment is a plus. A portfolio demonstrating your ability to capture attention and drive engagement is essential.</li>\n<li>The creativity and the analytics. You have substantial experience writing, editing, proofreading, and publishing content and an understanding of organic SEO, inbound marketing, full-funnel marketing, and content journeys. You've created valuable gated assets (ebooks, guides, checklists, etc.) that result in high landing page conversion rates and capture high-quality prospects for nurture.\u00a0</li>\n<li>The technical skills. You know how to rank on Google for a chosen keyword and have results you can share with us. You may have some experience with HubSpot or other marketing automation platforms.\u00a0</li>\n<li>The philosophy. You're self-driven with a desire to experiment, fail, learn, and grow. You're a team player who knows collaboration is the key to any organization's success.</li>\n<li>The communication and interpersonal skills. Your writing is exceptional, and you have equally strong oral and presentation skills. You can easily build a positive, professional relationship with stakeholders at any level, comfortably working across teams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why join us?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We are committed to creating a balanced, inclusive, and equitable workplace. </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We recognize and appreciate the varied experiences, backgrounds, and knowledge our team can bring to our culture, operations, products, and relationships internally and externally.</li>\n<li>We have an impactful recruitment diversity strategy to increase representation across the company at every level.
